# Monokai Arduino Theme
================

This is a updated version of Technobly's theme to work with the latest Arduino IDE (currently 1.8.1)

\- \- \-

####INSTALLATION
1. **PREFERENCES.TXT**  
On Windows, located here: `%AppData%\Roaming\Arduino` replace your `preferences.txt` with mine.
2. **THEME FOLDER**  
On Windows, located here: `..\Arduino\lib\` replace the `theme` folder inside (making a copy of the original in case you hate my changes!)
This folder contains a 'themes.txt' file with the bulk of the changes (mostly colors).  Buttons and tabs are stored as image files, which have been modified to fit the color scheme
